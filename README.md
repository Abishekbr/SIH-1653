## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Candidate Profile Creation:

Collects data about the candidate’s experience, expertise, and qualifications, which is used to generate personalized questions.
AI-Assisted Interviewer:

AI analyzes the candidate’s responses in real time and adapts the questions dynamically based on the answers, keeping the interview engaging and relevant.
Multimedia Questioning:

Questions are not limited to text but can include multimedia elements (e.g., images or code) that the candidate interacts with to demonstrate their skills.
Real-Time Feedback & Scoring:

Continuous scoring throughout the interview process, which gives the candidate an opportunity to improve during the interview.
The AI analyzes both the relevance and depth of answers using NLP, ensuring that the responses meet the expected standards.
Expert Panel Review:

After the interview, a human expert panel can review the AI-generated feedback and score, providing a final fine-tuning to the candidate’s performance evaluation.
Final Scoring & Decision:

A final score is provided, factoring in everything from question relevance, response quality, and expert panel feedback. This helps the hiring team decide on the candidate’s suitability for the role.
Advantages of this Approach:
Dynamic Interviews: The AI adapts in real time, keeping the interview relevant to the candidate’s skills and avoiding repetitive or irrelevant questions.
Engagement: Multimedia questions can better test the candidate's ability to work with real-world scenarios, especially for technical roles.
Real-Time Feedback: Candidates receive continuous feedback, improving their experience and ensuring they understand how they are performing during the interview.
Data-Driven Decision Making: AI-generated reports and feedback help human experts make more informed and objective decisions.
Scalability: AI-assisted interviewing systems can handle many candidates at once, making the process more efficient for large-scale recruitment efforts.
